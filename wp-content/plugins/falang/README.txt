Falang is the easiest multilanguage plugin you can use to translate a WordPress site.

== Description ==

Falang is a multilanguage plugin for WordPress. It allows you to translate an existing WordPress site to other languages. Falang natively supports WooCommerce (product, variation, category, tag, attribute, etc.)

= Free vs Pro =

Pro version: has on-site support and language filtering - [documentation](https://www.faboba.com/en/wordpress/falang-for-wordpress/documentation/134-how-to-use-lang-filtering.html)

= Concept =

* Easy setup
* Supports all languages supported by WordPress (RTL and LTR)
* When you add a language in Falang, WP language packages are automatically downloaded and updated
* Easy to use: Translate Posts, Pages, Menus, Categories from the plugin or linked from the WP interface
* Translate Posts and Terms permalinks
* Translate additional plugins like WooCommerce, Yoast SEO, etc.
* You can use Google, Azure, Yandex, Lingvanex to help you with the translation (DeepL services may be included in later versions)
* Displays the default language if the content is not yet translated
* The Language Switcher widget is configurable to display flags and/or language names
* Language Switcher can be put in Menu, Header, Footer, Sidebars
* Image captions, alt text and other media text translation without duplicating the media files
* Language Code directly in the URL
* No extra database tables created, no content duplication
* Very good website speed performance (low impact)
* Contains translations for IT, FR, DE, ES, NL
* Falang is not meant for WordPress multisite installations!

= Falang's goal is to let you translate everything on your page =

* Taxonomies
* Menu items
* Theme and plugin strings
* Custom fields
* Page builder content
* Widgets
* Shortcode outputs
* URL slugs
* WooCommerce products
* Page title and description
* Image alt text and captions
